# GMX_workflow
A workflow to parallelize multiple GROMACS molecular dynamics simulation
Instructions: Place all the .mol files for the molecular structures you wish to simulate with GROMACS in the same directory as the gmx_flow.py script and the 'Pre' folder, then simply run gmx_flow.py from that directory.
